This is an old combination discord and Twitch bot I made in C# with .NET Core (back when that was a thing).

This bot ran at the command line on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Linux, but was developed on a Windows desktop machine in Visual Studio.

NOTE: This bot no longer functions as the APIs for Twitch have changed since then and I did not update the bot.
